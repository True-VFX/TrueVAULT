This repository is a public variant for TrueVAULT.

## What is TrueVAULT?

TrueVAULT is a Blender add‑on created by TrueVFX to streamline artists’ workflows. At a high level, it provides convenient, integrated tools and curated content so you can spend less time on setup and more time creating.

- Access the TrueVAULT panel inside Blender to browse/use content and tools provided by the add‑on. Details and UI may vary by version—see the in‑app help for specifics.
